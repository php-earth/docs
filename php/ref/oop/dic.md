# What is dependency injection container in PHP?

To better understand dependency injection container, the
[dependency injection design pattern](/php/ref/oop/design-patterns/dependency-injection.md)
is a prerequisite.

Dependency injection container is very useful and recommended way of managing
class dependencies. It is an utility which helps you to implement the dependency
injection pattern in your application.

Dependency injection container is a combination of container design pattern,
factory pattern and (optionally) flyweight pattern when utilizing objects as
service descriptors. General implementations of dependency injection container
are also inspecting components (utilizing reflection).
