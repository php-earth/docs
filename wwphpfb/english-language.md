In this large [Facebook group](https://facebook.com/groups/2204685680) main speaking language and also language of the shared content
should be English. Many users have asked before why other languages or localizations are not allowed here?

Facebook groups currently do not have categories or so called sub-forums. That is why everything shared in this group is visible on
one timeline and topics cannot be moved to sub-categories of your prefered language.

Users of this group come from all over the world and English is the most spoken international language everywhere nowadays. English is also
the top language of the internet (800 million users). Try to picture conversation in the group as you would do in an international meeting
with people from all over the world. Yes, we would most likely talk in English.

But do **not** get the administrators wrong. We support and understand localization and internationalization issues, local cultures and people
whose first language is not English. Thanks to the awesome PHP community you can find your local PHP user group on **[php.net/ug](http://php.net/ug.php)**
which is based on the **[PHP.ug](http://php.ug)** where you can and should speak also in your local prefered language of the group.

We're sure you will figure this out sooner or later that computer science and tech industry in general has set English as its main language
of communication.

And besides all speaking English is also fun and you can improve your English skills.
