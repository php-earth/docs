Singleton pattern is creational design pattern where a class ensures it has only
one instance with lazy initialization, and can be accessed from a global scope.
It has encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use".

To solve this, we could use global variables (constants) inside a class. However
this doesn't makes class modular and can be used only for the current application
implementation. Therefore this is considered a bad practice. Another approach to
solve this would be to use the singleton pattern.

PHP example of the `Singleton` class:

```php
<?php

class Singleton
{
    /** @var Singleton Reference to singleton class instance */
    private static $instance;

    /**
     * Private constructor ensures the class can be initialized only from itself.
     */
    private function __construct() {}

    /**
     * Get a singleton class instance with lazy initialization only on first call.
     * Client code can therefore use only this accessor method to manipulate the
     * singleton.
     *
     * @return Singleton
     */
    public static function getInstance()
    {
        if (!isset(self::$instance)) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }

        return self::$instance;
    }

    /**
     * @throws Exception to prevent cloning object.
     */
    public function __clone()
    {
        throw new Exception('You cannot clone singleton object');
    }
}
```

The singleton pattern can be extended to support access to an application specific
number of instances.

Inheritance of the singleton class is not possible when using a static accessor
method. Also deleting an instance of a singleton class is a non-trivial design
problem.

## When to Use Singleton Pattern?

Singleton should be considered only if all of the following criteria are met:

* Ownership of the single instance cannot be reasonably assigned
* Lazy initialization is desirable
* Global access is not otherwise provided (in case of legacy applications)

If above criteria does not present implementation issues in the application code,
than the [dependency injection](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/dependency-injection/)
should be used for better testability and flexible maintainability most of the
time.

When accessing global scope, the advantage of singleton pattern over global
variables is that it ensures the number of instances which can be changed to
any required number any time.

The same as using global variables inside classes, the singleton pattern
implemented on class level is considered an anti-pattern because it reduces
testability and maintainability of the code. To replace global variables with
singleton is a wrong approach to solve access of global scope from a class.

Singleton can be used when it is simpler to pass an object resource as a reference
to the objects that need it instead of letting objects access the resource
globally. It might be useful and handy to use singleton, but the appropriate
visibility of an object must be thought through.

The singleton pattern implemented on factory, incubator or service container
level is not an anti-pattern. Abstract factory, builder, and prototype can use
singleton in their implementation. Facade and state objects are often singleton
also, because only one class instance is required.
