Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create
new objects by copying this prototype. Co-opt one instance of a class for use
as a breeder of all future instances. The new operator considered harmful.

## Problem

Application "hard wires" the class of object to create in each "new" expression.

## Discussion

Declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual "clone" method, and
maintains a dictionary of all "cloneable" concrete derived classes. Any class that
needs a "polymorphic constructor" capability: derives itself from the abstract
base class, registers its prototypical instance, and implements the clone()
operation.

The client then, instead of writing code that invokes the "new" operator on a
hard-wired class name, calls a "clone" operation on the abstract base class,
supplying a string or enumerated data type that designates the particular concrete
derived class desired.

## Structure

The Factory knows how to find the correct Prototype, and each Product knows how
to spawn new instances of itself.

## Example

The Prototype pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical
instance. Prototypes of new products are often built prior to full production,
but in this example, the prototype is passive and does not participate in copying
itself. The mitotic division of a cell - resulting in two identical cells - is
an example of a prototype that plays an active role in copying itself and thus,
demonstrates the Prototype pattern. When a cell splits, two cells of identical
genotype result. In other words, the cell clones itself.

## Check list

1. Add a clone() method to the existing "product" hierarchy.
2. Design a "registry" that maintains a cache of prototypical objects. The
    registry could be encapsulated in a new Factory class, or in the base class
    of the "product" hierarchy.
3. Design a factory method that: may (or may not) accept arguments, finds the
    correct prototype object, calls clone() on that object, and returns the
    result.
4. The client replaces all references to the new operator with calls to the
    factory method.

## Rules of a thumb

* Sometimes creational patterns are competitors: there are cases when either
    Prototype or Abstract Factory could be used properly. At other times they are
    complementory: Abstract Factory might store a set of Prototypes from which
    to clone and return product objects. Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype
    can use Singleton in their implementations.
* Abstract Factory classes are often implemented with Factory Methods, but they
    can be implemented using Prototype.
* Factory Method: creation through inheritance. Protoype: creation through
    delegation. Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated,
    more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory,
    Protoype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.
* Prototype doesn't require subclassing, but it does require an "initialize" operation. Factory Method requires subclassing, but doesn't require Initialize.
* Designs that make heavy use of the Composite and Decorator patterns often can benefit from Prototype as well.
* Prototype co-opts one instance of a class for use as a breeder of all future instances.
* Prototypes are useful when object initialization is expensive, and you anticipate few variations on the initialization parameters. In this context, Prototype can avoid expensive "creation from scratch", and support cheap cloning of a pre-initialized prototype.
* Prototype is unique among the other creational patterns in that it doesn't require a class â€“ only an object. Object-oriented languages like Self and Omega that do away with classes completely rely on prototypes for creating new objects.

## Code

```php
<?php

class SubObject
{
    static $instances = 0;
    public $instance;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->instance = ++self::$instances;
    }

    public function __clone()
    {
        $this->instance = ++self::$instances;
    }
}

class MyCloneable
{
    public $object1;
    public $object2;
    public function __clone()
    {
        // Force a copy of this->object, otherwise it will point to same object.
        $this->object1 = clone $this->object1;
    }
}

$obj = new MyCloneable();

$obj->object1 = new SubObject();
$obj->object2 = new SubObject();

$obj2 = clone $obj;

print("Original Object:\n");
print_r($obj);

print("Cloned Object:\n");
print_r($obj2);
```

## Output

```
Original Object:
MyCloneable Object
(
    [object1] => SubObject Object
        (
            [instance] => 1
        )

    [object2] => SubObject Object
        (
            [instance] => 2
        )

)
Cloned Object:
MyCloneable Object
(
    [object1] => SubObject Object
        (
            [instance] => 3
        )

    [object2] => SubObject Object
        (
            [instance] => 2
        )

)
```
