Design patterns are recurring solutions to common problems in software designing.

## The recommended major principles of programming

It is recommend to acknowledge the following principles before starting with
design patterns.
Without the strict following of this principles design patterns (and OOP in
general) makes no sense.

* [K.I.S.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
* [D.R.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
* [Principle of Parsimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)
* [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
* [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

## Types of design patterns

According to the Gang of Four book we can categorize design patterns into three
main categories:

### Creational design patterns

* [Abstract Factory](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/abstract-factory/)
* [Builder](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/builder/)
* [Prototype](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/prototype/)
* [Singleton](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/singleton/)

### Structural design patterns

* [Adapter](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/adapter/)
* [Bridge](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/bridge/)
* [Composite](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/composite/)
* [Decorator](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/decorator/)
* [Facade](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/facade/)
* [Flyweight](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/flyweight/)
* [Proxy](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/proxy/)

### Behavioral design patterns

* [Chain of responsibility](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/)
* [Command](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/command/)
* [Intepreter](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/interpreter/)
* [Iterator](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/iterator/)
* [Mediator](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/mediator/)
* [Memento](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/memento/)
* [Observer](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/observer/)
* [State](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/state/)
* [Strategy](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/strategy/)
* [Template method](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/template-method/)
* [Visitor](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/visitor/)

### Other design patterns

Other design patterns that are important to know for complex applications:

* [Dependency injection](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/dependency-injection/)
* [Lazy loading](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/lazy-loading/)
* [Mock object](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/mock-object/)
* [Null object](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/null-object/)
* [Object pool](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/object-pool/)
* [Servant](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/servant/)
* [Type tunnel](/faq/object-oriented-programming/design-patterns/type-tunnel/)
