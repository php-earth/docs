SOLID is a collection of good programming practices for object oriented programming
and consists of 6 principles. These aren't the rules you should be following
strictly everywhere. These are more like best practices you should use if possible
and understand. If there will be better practices found and developed besides
these, they will be extended or explained in a separate chapters also.

SOLID stands for:

* **S** as Single responsibility principle
* **O** as Open/close principle
* **L** as Liskov segregation principle
* **I** as Interface segregation principle
* **D** as Dependency inversion principle

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Single responsibility principle states that each class or module should have
one and only one role or responsibility.

## Open/Close Principle (OC)

Open/close principle states that each class should be open for extension and at
the same time closed for modification.

## Liskov Segregation Principle (LSP)

Liskov segregation principle states that objects should be replaceable with instances
of any of their parent classes.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interface segregation principle states that classes should not be limited and
locked for accepting more of their kind.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency inversion principle states that classes should depend on abstractions
rather than only certain class dependencies. Abstraction should be implemented
without detailed functionality so classes can use the abstraction and extend it
accordingly.
