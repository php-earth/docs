# C programming basics

## Hello, World

The following program is a basic `Hello, World` program where text is printed to
a screen.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Going line by line:

* `#include <stdio.h>` - this includes a standard IO header file from your system
  in your program, so the `printf` function works. In C programs there are many
  standard library header files used from the system and they come with the
  compiler, so you don't need to reinvent everything and you have best practices
  at your disposal.
* `int main()` - each C program starts with a `main()` function. The `int`
  keyword indicates that `main` returns a value of integer type.
* `{` and `}` - curly brackets wrap a block of code such as `main` function.
* `printf("Hello, World\n");` - this prints text `Hello, World` text and a new
  line on your screen when program is compiled and run. The additional `\n` stands
  for a new line character.
* `return 0;` - the `main` function returns a value 0.

## Compiling

To be able to run your `Hello, World` program, you need to first compile it.

To compile a C program, you need to have a compiler. In above case we will use a
`gcc` compiler.

```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello.o
```

* `gcc` is a command for running a compiler
* `hello.c` is a C source code file with above code
* `-o hello.o` is optional and defines a binary file that is created. If left out
  the output file will be automatically set by compiler. For example, `a.out`.

You can then run this C program by executing

```bash
./hello.o
```

Which prints in command line:

```txt
Hello, World
```

## Arguments and return values

You can pass arguments to `main()`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello, %s\n", argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

* `int main(...)` - means that the `main()` function will return a value of integer
  type.
* `int argc` - first argument defines the number of arguments that will be passed
  to the compiled program.
* `char **argv` - the second argument defines an array of character strings.

Let's compile and run the program:

```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello.o
./hello.o "PHP"
```

The output of above program will be:

```text
Hello, PHP
```

## Code comments

In C there are two types of comments:

* Single line comments

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// This is a single line comment
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

* Multi line comments

They are wrapped between `/*` and `*/`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/*
 * This is a multi line comment.
 */
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
}
```
