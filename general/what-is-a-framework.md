Framework is a tool to help you develop applications faster and better. It is a reusable set of libraries and/or classes. They usually define
default folder structure of a project.

There are many existing, well established and secure open source frameworks with large communities behind them. Rather than reinventing the wheel
many developers use them to built web applications. There is **NO best** and **NO official** PHP framework, because different purposes and
different projects require different tools and approaches.

In your career path you will not need to know all of them but you should learn how to use few of the frameworks that
are widely used in industry or are important to you. Before diving into a framework get yourself familiar with some advanced concepts such as OOP,
design patterns, ORM, authentication, MVC (model view controller) etc. For bigger projects usage of popular open source frameworks instead of your
custom one or procedural programming is advised.

According to the architecture the framework itself is built upon there are three major types of frameworks we will use to categorize them in this
FAQ:

## Component frameworks

Component frameworks are built and decoupled into separate components that you can use in your application independently on other components.
You can just use some components or all of them.

* [Aura](http://auraphp.github.com/)
* [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/)
* [Nette](http://nette.org/en/)
* [Symfony](http://symfony.com)
* [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com)

## Full stack frameworks

Full stack framework includes everything you need to develop an application in one package. Decoupling of compoments is mostly not possible.
Most of component frameworks can be also full stack framework at the same time.

## Micro frameworks

Micro framework holds simple core with very lightweight infrastructure of classes and libraries. Main purpose of micro frameworks is fast building of application
and still keep lightning speed of performance with small footprint.

* [Bullet PHP](http://github.com/vlucas/bulletphp)
