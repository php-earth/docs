Building desktop applications with only PHP language is not the usual way of creating such applications as is with Java, Adobe Air, C#, Python but yes it can be done as well and things are getting quite interesting on this field as well. Building desktop applications with PHP is useful for having also server side part of the application covered with PHP.

## Resources:

* [PHP GTK](http://gtk.php.net/) - extension for PHP language that implements language bindings for GTK+ and simplifies writing client-side cross-platform GUI applications. Issue with PHP GTK is outdated and almost a dead project.
* [PHP Nightrain](http://www.naetech.com/php-nightrain) - deploy and run HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP web applications as a native desktop application on Windows, Mac and the Linux operating systems
* [TideSDK](http://www.tidesdk.org/) - create multi-platform desktop apps with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP among other languages.
* [wxPHP](http://wxphp.org/) - wxWidgets for PHP, binding/wrapper for the cross-platform library wxWidgets, which gives you the ability to develop desktop applications using PHP.
